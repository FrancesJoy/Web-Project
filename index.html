                <br />
                The town doctors told Sachi's mother that her giving birth would be risky since the baby is unhealthy and might die when out of her womb. Sachi's father made his wife drink a potion he received from a traveler deeming that the potion could give her mother a healthy and beautiful child. But then, both were shocked and relieved when they both found out that the potion did work and that the child was born beautiful and healthy. They then give her the name, "Sachi" , which means "Happiness" since both her parents felt joy at the time of her birth. Though as time goes by, something was sprouting from Sachi's head which they later found out were antlers like that of a deer. Due to this she was often bullied at school and laughed when walking around the town. After years passed by, Sachi is now 15 and that's when she realized that the potion her mother drank isn't only giving her antlers but it is also changing her whole being. Her eyes glow and certain things become clearer in the dark, Her drink goes into a weird color whenever she touches it and many more. Both her parents ignored her, saying that they do not have a freakish child. Having enough of the changes, she left and then later found a nearby town where travelers, Half humans and creatures stay. She met a nice old lady that is an expert when it comes to potion. The old lady treated her like a granddaughter. And as years passed by she then make potions for travelers, alchemists and tavern keepers. Her potions could do things such as healing, boosting the characters skills, transformations and many more. She then became a popular potion maker in her new town.

                <b>How she met her significant other:</b>
                <br />
                While on a hunt to seek ingredients for her upcoming potions, she comes across a clearing where she found a mysterious slouched figure resting on a tree nearby. She then found out that the figure is severely wounded thus she helped what she suppose is a him. She later found out that he is a Shadow Knight , a dangerous creature that hunts down other creatures tasked to him, and his name is "Ryuunosuke". Ryuunosuke then swore that he will protect her, kissing her shadow he vowed to be her familiar.
